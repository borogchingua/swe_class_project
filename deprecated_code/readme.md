# Deprecated Code Vault

This folder contains code that is obsolete or otherwise no
longer needed.  We keep it for reference, or if something breaks.

Remove documentation of old code and store it in here for posterity,
or as a warning to our future selves lest we attempt to recreate
these blunders.
